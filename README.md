# XV6 Linux Kernel Modifications

This repository contains assignments and modifications made to the XV6 Linux kernel as part of the "Operačné systémy" course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology of the Slovak Technical University in Bratislava. The course is structured similarly to the MIT course "Operating Systems Engineering" (6.828), which uses the XV6 Linux kernel.

## Course Information

- **University**: Slovak Technical University in Bratislava
- **Faculty**: Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (FEI)
- **Course Name**: Operačné systémy (Operating Systems)
- **Course Website**: [https://uim.fei.stuba.sk/b-os-2021/](https://uim.fei.stuba.sk/b-os-2021/)
- **MIT Course Reference**: [Operating Systems Engineering (6.828)](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/)

## Course Overview
The course covers fundamental concepts in operating systems and practical applications using XV6 Linux kernel. Topics include:
- Introduction to Operating Systems
- System Calls
- Processes and Threads
- Process Scheduling
- Process Synchronization
- Memory Management
- File Systems
- Interrupts
- System Programming

Each assignment is organized into its own branch.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

## BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
